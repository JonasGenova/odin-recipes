        <p>Creme brülée, also known as bumt cream or Trinity
         cream, and virtually identical to crema catalana, is a
         dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a
         layer of hardened caramelized sugar.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients List</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 large egg yolks</li>

            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <dl>
        <p><dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
           <dd>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Move an oven rack to the lowest position.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
           <dd>Whisk egg yolks, 1/4 white sugar, and vanilla together in a heatproof bowl until smooth. Bring cream just to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; gradually whisk hot cream into egg yolk mixture (a little at a time to prevent the mixture from scrambling), whisking continuously until combined.</dd></p> 

        <p><dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
           <dd>Bring a couple of inches of water to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat; set the bowl with cream mixture over the saucepan to form a double boiler. Cook, gently stirring with a wooden spoon, until cream mixture thickens enough to easily coat the back of the spoon.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
           <dd>Pour hot cream into a heat-proof baking dish or individual ramekins set on a rimmed baking sheet. Place in the preheated oven; bake until mixture sets but has a slight jiggle, about 20 to 30 minutes.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 5</b></dt>
           <dd>Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 6</b></dt>
           <dd>To make the topping: Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 7</b></dt>
           <dd>Combine 2 tablespoons white sugar and brown sugar in a small bowl; sprinkle evenly over cold crème brûlée.</dd></p>

        <p><dt><b>Step 8</b></dt>
           <dd>Heat under the preheated broiler until sugar melts and browns, 2 to 3 minutes; return immediately to the refrigerator and chill until sugar is set, about 15 minutes.</dd></p>
