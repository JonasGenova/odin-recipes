This is the first project of my Odin Project journey, titled "Odin-Recipes." The task is to create a simple website featuring a particular dish, complete with a list of ingredients, instructions, and examples of the dish.

For this project, I have created a simple three-course meal, consisting of an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert.

Throughout my coding journey, I plan to revisit each project and apply my new learnings to improve and iterate on my work. I will track my progress, and for each version of the project, I will document the changes and improvements I have made. These documents will be attached to the website itself.
